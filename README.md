"Humans may crave absolute certainty; they may aspire to it; they may pretend, as partisans of certain religions do, to have attained it. But the history of science - by far the most successful claim to knowledge accessible to humans - teaches that the most we can hope for is successive improvement in our understanding, learning from our mistakes, an asymptotic approach to the Universe, but with the proviso that absolute certainty will always elude us." Carl Sagan ; The Demon-Haunted World : Science as a Candle in the Dark

Empirical research never really comes to an end. One of the reasons for this is that we do not have 100 percent certainty regarding the results when evaluating the data. In order to better assess the stability of the findings, studies must therefore be replicated.

One purpose of replications is the search for methodological artifacts. Regarding statistical evaluation, robust techniques should therefore be used for replications - techniques that are less susceptible to producing statistical artifacts. In this respect, replications are particularly valuable when they are not identical to the original study in terms of statistical methods, but rather represent an extension in this regard.

Nexus is a knowledge base and provides tools (software) for robust statistical procedures.
